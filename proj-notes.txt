Input: 
Output: 

nTrend == nPrevTrend
Yes: Randomize nTrend until nTrend != nPrevTrend

ALGORITHM: 
1 User begins with 5000 nBells
2 Sunday: Display random price (90-110 Bells) of buying turnips
3 Ask the user if they want to buy turnips
	3.1 Yes: Ask how many turnips to buy
		3.1.1 Valid input: Bells subtract and turnips add; program proceeds to step 4
		3.1.2 Invalid input: Display how many turnips they can buy and proceed step 2
	3.2 No: Program proceeds to step 
Monday to Saturday: 
4 Check if user has 0 turnips
	4.1 Yes: Next week begins and program proceeds to step 2
	4.2 No: Program proceeds to step 5
5 Random trend is selected
6 Check if current week trend is equal to previous week trend
	6.1 Yes: Randomize trend until current week trend is unequal to previous week trend
	6.2 No: Program proceeds to step 7
7 Turnips selling price is within random: average, awesome, or bad trend
8 Display random price of selling turnips
9 Ask the user if they want to sell turnips
	9.1 Yes: Bells and turnips update
		9.1.1 Valid input: Bells add and turnips subtract
		9.1.2 Invalid input: Display how many turnips they can sell and do step 3
	9.2 No: Proceed to next day; do step 9
10 After Saturday, if user still holds turnips, turnips expire
11 After final day of final week
	11.1 Yes: Program proceeds to step 12
	11.2 No: Program proceeds to step 2
12 Check if user has 1 000 000 Bells
	12.1 Yes: "Congratulations!"
	12.2 No: "Try again!"

MUST:
- use user-defined functions
- use pointers
- use loops
- use conditions
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rand-and-srand-in-ccpp/ on how to use rand() and srand()
- perform coding "incrimentally":
	- divide the program specification into subproblems to solve each problem separately
	- coding the solutions to the subproblems one at a time
		- test and debug after a solution for one subproblem
- pass paremeters to functions

! Click Project/Build options, then in tab Compiler Settings choose subtab Other options, and place -std=c99 in the text area, and click Ok. This will turn C99 mode on for your Compiler.

NOT ALLOWED TO:
- declare/use global/static variables
- use goto statements
- use the break statement to exit a block other than switch blocks
- use the return statemenet or exit statement to prematurely terminate a loop/function/program
- use the exist statement to prematurely terminate a loop or terminate the function/program
- call the main() function to repeat the process instead of using loops

FOR DOCUEMNTATION, INCLUDE:
- file/introductory comments before preprocessor directives
- function comments
- in-line comments
